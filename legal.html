                <p>Naval Ravikant is an angel investor and a part-time philosopher. He has this amazing tweet storm called Getting Rich Without Getting Lucky, in this tweet storm he talks about how to be rich using the leverage of the internet. There is a good book by Eric Jorgenson combining all the podcasts and tweets of Navl called The Almanak of Naval Ravikant. In this article, I will share the top five things that Naval Ravikant said about getting rich. You can also use this wisdom to become wealthy.</p>
                <h4>1.Learn to sell, Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.</h4>
                <p>Selling and building is the most important part of getting wealthy. If you know how to sell you can sell products and earn commission on the sales you do. If you know how to build (Building a course or YouTube video etc.) you earn by producing content on the internet. So if you can do both that's your key to wealth.</p>
                <h4>2.You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.</h4>
                <p>If they know how to get it then they can easily replace you or pay you less. If society can train you to do it then in time they can train a computer to do it or train someone else.</p>
                <h4>3.Code and media are permissionless leverage. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.</h4>
                <p>They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. If you don’t know how to code create blogs and record podcasts. Code and media are permissionless leverage you don’t need anyone's permission to create them.</p>
                <h4>4.You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity — a piece of a business to gain your financial freedom.</h4>
                <p>If you want to achieve financial independence, it’s wise to invest in a business rather than simply working for someone else and trading time for money.</p>
                <h4>5.The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn.</h4>
                <p>If you want to become rich, you need to have a thirst for knowledge and always be open to learning new things. The key is to be resourceful and find ways to acquire the knowledge you need to succeed.</p>
